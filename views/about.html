      <p class="fs-3 _book ls-1">The tech-world continously grows and gets bigger by the day. We constantly experience new technology and if you aren’t up to speed then everyday things can sadly become more challenging for you. The requirements of digital knowledge and the possession of a phone/ and or other digital devices are also becoming larger. The people in Sweden are becoming more and more reliant on using digital tools to be able to complete simple day-to-day tasks. If you want to book a time at the doctors or buy a bus ticket, you are almost forced to use a phone in some way. Many people are of course happy about this development since it’s easier for them to interact with technology. However, there’s a part of the population that didn’t grow up with technology and for them it’s more difficult to hang in there.</p>
